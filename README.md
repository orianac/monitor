Monitor
=======
`monitor` is a near real-time monitor of environmental conditions,
designed to be run through the work flow package ecFlow.

## Overview:
Monitor has four main components.

	Contains scripts for the manipulation of meteorological data, 
including to download, regrid, and generate subdaily forcings.

**Models**  `/monitor/tools/bin/ecflow/processes/main/models/`
	Contains scripts to conduct model runs. Initial implementation
uses the model `VIC`.

**Post-Processing**  `/monitor/tools/bin/ecflow/processes/main/post_processing/`
	Contains scripts to analyze the model output.
